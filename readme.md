# Translate HTML

Translate an html page from english to spanish. 

## How to use

- This project uses [LibreTranslate](https://github.com/LibreTranslate/LibreTranslate) running locally as a translation service, so follow the instructions there to run it. I found Docker Compose to be the most convenient way.
